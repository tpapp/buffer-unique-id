* Overview

The function =insert-buffer-unique-id= inserts a random string, for example =x195a=. The starting string (=x= by default), the number of characters that follow (4 by default) and the string they are picked from can be customized.

The unique id is generated randomly, retrying if it is already present in the buffer. This is not a sophisticated algorithm and may fail or be inefficient in corner cases, but should suffice for the most common use case.

I wrote this when I was dealing with an R file which had many small statistical models, which I had to keep track of, and naming them was becoming tiresome.
